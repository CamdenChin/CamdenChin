### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science and Media Studies student at Duke University with hands-on experience across a variety of fields. My journey has taken me from working as a Streaming Operations Intern at NBC Sports, where I contributed to streaming solutions for millions of viewers, to developing backend systems as part of ONEDOT, a marketing agency specializing in Shopify. Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to dive into media production and content creation during my time as a Research Intern at Wheelhouse Media Group.

Additionally, I've contributed to academia as a Teaching Assistant at Duke University and am currently building an assignment delivery system for internal use within the Computer Science department. Iâ€™m always excited to explore new technologies and collaborate on innovative projects.

Check out my repositories to see what I've been working on, and feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
